# react-native-todo-app
Basic react native todo application using Expo and MongoDB. 

This was a small personal project so I could learn/self-teach how to build CRUD applications with react native.

The aim is to use this project is to: 
- Learn how to build CRUD applications. 
- Full stack development basics.
- To take the learnings of this project and apply to a real project in the future.
